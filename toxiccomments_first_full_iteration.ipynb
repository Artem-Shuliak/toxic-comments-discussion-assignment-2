In the Christian view mercy is the decisive step after justice is reached. Therefore the Christians in the courtroom urge mercy. Beside the fact, that Shylock as a Jew is not in duty to give mercy, he is not able as well, because for this you need love. He doesn't find love at all, but hate. Shakespeare explains this in Shylock's monologue very clearly. To be merciful despite the hate nevertheless you have to love your enemy (New Testament). That means in fact that the Christians in the courtroom urge Shylock to behave like a very true Christian by loving his enemies although they themselves failed even in loving just their neighbours (the Jews) in the past before.\"\"\n",

Then all I did is put a reference to it under \"\"See Also\"\" on the Psychiatry and Biopsychiatry Controversy pages.

      "I'm still under the gun with that project I mentioned and am amazed that my last note was as long as it is!! Wanted to reply to a few points for the moment...I'm using numbered points because it makes it easier for you (and me) to refer back to.\n",
      "1. Regardingn my making a clear distinction between me/us and \"\"your editorial colleagues\"\", yes, you're right. I guess I don't know enough about WikiP yet, but I clearly don't have access to the same \"\"additional facilities\"\" (which I take to mean \"\"tools\"\") as you, so I don't have the same control.\n",
      "Sure, I could put a Copyvio on someone's page, but I rather doubt it would stay there any more than my {db}s did  I assume Copyvio notices are either 1. sent to all admins (or those who deal with Copyvios specifically), and/or 2. posted to the Copyvio page for you and your colleagues to make some sort of determination on. From what you say above, it appears that some Uber Admin(s) makes the final determination.\n",
      "2. Also regarding \"\"tools\"\" I and, I suspect, most WikiP contributors have no power to Lock and page to insure it doesn't get Reverted by anyone else. Nor can we Delete a page, even our own. Nor do we have access, as I assume you do, to EB and other pay services to check for likely infringements.\n",
      "There are even several services used by educational institutions which faculty regularly use to check for plagiarism in term papers, theses, etc. Perhaps you also have access to those? You didn't indicate how that EB page was accessed since the public can only get the \"\"teaser\"\" entry for Crapsey.\n",
      "Thus, to paraphrase your quote and the old axiom: \"\"we are all peers, with equal power to edit, but some of us are more equal than others!\"\"\n",
      "3. Regarding your statement that it's \"\"actually relatively rare for a copyvio to be contested, and most pass without comment,\"\" are you saying that once a Copyvio is pointed out, the \"\"offending contributor\"\" simply concedes the point and allows the page to be removed without so much an objection?!! That's truly astouonding  I'd imagine that most folks do not deliberately borrow from others, however similiar the contents might be.\n",
      "Have no idea what you mean by \"\"the ones that are contested often end up in the sections at the top of the page.\"\" Can you point me to a sample of this?\n",
      "4. Regarding your statement that \"\"he EB page I'm referring to is , the one originally referenced  what do you mean? Referenced by whom? By your colleague?\n",
      "Or are you obliquely saying that WikiP has the means of reading contributor hard drive caches and Recent URL lists to determine where they've been?! I know I didn't reference EB and don't know how you access their pay service, but if you're in fact suggesting that WikiP can somehow monitor member hard drives, I'd find that VERY disturbing...an outright privacy violation. Will run AdAware & Spybot S&D; just to see if anything they regard as \"\"malicious\"\" turns up with WikiP fingerprints on it! ;-) \n",
      "5. On your reply to 3 above that \"\"Wikipedia does not, in general, use text 'with permission,' \"\" I'm confused. The passage I quoted suggests that the authors are granting WikiP a GFDL \"\"license,\"\" which, from my understanding of the law, means \"\"with permission.\"\" The author still \"\"owns\"\" the material and, presumably can make whatever other use s/he wants of it but cannot expect payment from WikiP, restrict the editing of, or, for that matter, even withdraw permission for work submitted to WikiP.\n",
      "6. Regarding your answer to 5 above that you \"\"don't have access to any special posting info. It's all available to everyone, although some of it is better hidden or harder to use,\"\" this sort of relates to my #1 immediately above, and I guess I'm confused again. How in the world would Admins and other \"\"watchers\"\" like you (still don't know what your title is) know \"\"what's new\"\" on WikiP if you don't get notices or have some list you can comb through? Are you saying there's an actual public list of all new articles? If so, where is it, and what prompts you folks to check one article vs. another?\n",

Furthermore, too much is made of Dudley Edward's Unionism, her biography was welcomed across the spectrum and was pioneering in its novelty and the various questions it asked. Desmond Ryan, a student and admirer of Pearse, said some very similar things a generation before, so please have some perspective. 86.40.207.29\n",

A quick glance spotted a couple. Robbie Williams, for example, has just won a defamation case yet we still had him in as debated when legally it has been ruled that there is nothing debatable about his orientation!!! Frankly, given the legal complexities with listing people here I'd go further and advocate that either the page be deleted as too much of a defamation risk, or be kept semi-protected to stop the constant adding in of vandalistic edits by anonymous editors who edit no pages but this one. It might be an idea to protect the page completely for a day while a couple of users sifted through all the names on it to make sure that there are no defamationary claims sitting there that weren't spotted by those honorable editors like Bearcat who spent their time constantly stopping vandalism here.

Or maybe he is a spy or something I guess that will be your next suggestion..... if you want scandal about dad find it elsewhere not where you are looking. MSDS\n",

Every image above said that it was taken from somewhere, and that's generally not allowed.  There are some specific exceptions, but I don't see them applying.  You should read the Copyright FAQ, specifically section 1.1 and 4.  If you took something from somewhere and modified it, it would count as a derivative work.

That's good for Wikipedia, but if you think the picture is of great quality, you may wish to retain the copyright and instead license it with one of the GFDL licenses, which are still accepted on Wikipedia.  If this is something you want to do, I'll be happy to guide you through selecting an appropriate license for your needs.\n",

It doesn't look like any of the remaining images can't conceivably be replaced by free alternatives, and none of them are absolutely essential to the articles they're used in.

This is probably not the full list of what I still have to talk to them about either, I just scanned my last email to them. We also were talking about an information session with the legal team, which was in the works last time we talked, but both sides got busy and were not able to do it in the scheduled time frame.

Where these 'perennial' discussions never lead to progress is because so many  people chip in without knowing what has been previously  discussed - a typical  example is User:Protonk who leaps in with a TLDR speech, but does not offer one single solution then complains at me because I have the decency - and the civility - not to name names, and not to  take his bait. I always have a distrust for admins who can't keep a civil tongue in  their heads.

Period. With  the exception  of two or three who  failed on technicalities in  2010/2011, all  the others that  failed shouldn't  even have wasted our time with  their applications anyway. I  mean, just  look  through them. Many people want to be admins for all the wrong reasons -  some even join  Wikipedia with  the intention of wanting  to  be an admin as soon  as possible. Take a deep breath, look back, and try to figure out why, for example I have never run for adminship in spite of my  maturity (61, retired professor), 26,000 edits since 2006, squeaky clean record (no  warnings, blocks, or deleted files or pages), civility, clue, and helpfulness (WP:EAR - 350 user questions answered), balanced involvement  in  Wikpedia policy  development (NPP,  BLP, 100 page creations and some GA, and micromanaging  a major project).

Thus they can miss that the preceding series of edits might be bad, as they focus on just the latest edit or the latest editor.  I've seen a number of times where simply reverting the latest most obvious bad edit actually restores another vandal's bad edits.  Thus I slog along my watchlist checking recent histories manually.

It is certainly not criminal in Iran for Kurds to have the Kurdish flag or symbol as many of my friends do. So edit your statement about it being criminal in Iran. Need I remind you all, that Kurds are ethnic Iranians and have historically enjoyed the greatest liberties in Iran as opposed to the mainstream discrimination Kurds face in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey?  \n",

      "Furthermore, I go on to read that there was research done that basically proves Kurds and Jews are genetically the same. It seems to me that certain individuals who I can see are Israeli are following the Israeli states policy of editing articles in lines with current events in the Middle East. Kurds are Iranians just as how Russians, Serbs, Poles, and Bulgarians are all Slavic peoples. Israel, the USA, and Britain are trying to create conflict in Iran as was done in the former Yugoslavia by creating problems along ethnic lines. This is called ‘balkanisation.’ The Israelis are doing this covertly through operations in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n",

I am alarmed by the current purging of internet articles that have hidden agendas trying to separate the Iranian identity of Kurds. \n",

      "As I was told by a Kurdish professor, Mr. Eskandari in Tehran: “Kurds are Iranian and the entity of Iran as a state and nation was founded by the [main] ancestors of the Kurds, the Mede who established Iran as an empire. One problem that has compounded the issue is that people misuse the term Persian and Iranian. Persians are Iranian, but all Iranians, like the Kurds and Ossetians, are not Persians.”\n",

There was a time when the Turkish government tried to convince Kurds that they were “Mountain Turks” and now there are powers at play that are either trying to disassociate the Kurds from their Iranian identity and origins or make whole generations of proud young Kurds forget or be unaware of their Iranian ethnicity. This is due to geo-strategic schemes. These forces are trying to victimize a whole group of people from knowing their own proud history and culture which is genuinely Iranian. The covert foreign policy of Israel, Britain, and America comes at the expense of the Kurds and even their history and culture.\n",

      "Section \"\"Expert opinion\"\", subsection \"\"Academia\"\" has a table listing the number of Wikipedia citations in Elsevier's ScienceDirect database. I think this is a very good way of showing the growing acceptance of Wikipedia by academics, but there are two problems. First of all, the link to the search results (footnote) is broken. Second, it's not clear to me at all how (using which search parameters) the numbers were obtained. I tried to reproduce the search results using the search string \"\"wikipedia.org/wiki\"\". For the year 2009, for example, I get 533 hits if I search just the References sections of articles, and I get 820 hits if I search the whole articles. I didn't manage to get the 614 hits that are listed in the table for 2009. When the table is remade, all search parameters (search string, search parts of articles etc.) should be stated in the footnote, otherwise it will remain mysterious how the numbers were obtained.\"\n",

I see two other seventies (though I can't remember who) that are listed as Assistant Executive Directors of the Temple Department, but under Zivic's LDS.org biography, that assignment is not listed. Is it possible that this was a previous assignment that he has now been released from? As soon as LDS.org has an updated list of assignments, I guess we'll know for sure. Please respond on my talk page, as I don't habitually check other users' talk page for a response. Thanks.   \n",

Actually, as I recall, it does not list anything subsequent to his previous service in an area presidency.  I obtained the information from other directories I reviewed.  There are actually 4 assistants at the present time to William Walker, in his role as Executive Director.  Hope that helps some.  Thanks for the question to ensure we're on track.   \n",

I am personally for the \"\"Fourth International (United Secretariat)\"\" title because, while I am generally (not officially) a supporter of the FI, I recognize that there is some historical ambiguity, and am seriously interested in the neutrality question here on Wikipedia.  When you mention the FI, you are invariably asked \"\"which one?\"\"  And the truth is that \"\"United Secretariat\"\" will always answer the question.  I feel that it's different from titling the article \"\"United Secretariat of the Fourth International,\"\" which is misleading, as that's the now-defunct body that directed the FI for 40 years.  We're disambiguating, because \"\"Fourth International\"\" is touchy ground for Trotskyists outside of the FI (you know which one).  \"\"Reunified Fourth International\"\" isn't used by anybody.  \"\"Fourth International (1963)\"\" posits a 1963 founding that didn't really happen.  \"\"Fourth International (United Secretariat)\"\" is also parallel to Fourth International (ICR), where the organization identifies itself as \"\"The Fourth International\"\" but the article uses a no-longer-present body to disambiguate it.  Any move at this point is going to be, in some respect, not entirely neutral in its point of view.  Given that reality, I think that recognizing convention and using the United Secretariat, while clearly explaining the nomenclature issues up front in the article, remains the best way to present the FI as it has been since 1963.    \"\n",

      "The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America and areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green within the gold and/or on the outskirts when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.\n",

      "\n",
      "The history of Kemah, Texas goes back more than 180 years. The Karankawa Indians, a group of five nomadic, linguistically related groups including the Cocos, Cujanes, Karankawas proper, Coapites, and Copanos, occupied the area from Galveston Bay to Corpus Christi Bay during the late Spring and Summer months. Evidence of the Karankawas near present-day Kemah was discovered back in the 1890s. This discovery will be discussed later in the article. Indian inhabitants began to leave when European settlers arrived, and most had retreated from the area by 1850.\n",
      "\n",
      " THE DISAPPEARING FOUNDER \n",
      "\n",
      "The recorded history of Kemah began in the early 1800s, when Texas was still under the Mexican flag. On August 24, 1824, the Mexican government granted a labor (approx. 177 acres) of land to to a settler by the name of Michael Gouldrich. Gouldrich was listed as one of Stephen F. Austin’s first colonists in 1826, a widower over 50 years of age engaged in farming and stockraising. His land was located on the south bank of Clear Creek, where the creek flows into Galveston Bay. Oddly enough, Gouldrich disappeared from historical record after his recorded receipt of the land grant. No historical records or accounts identify him with any development of a settlement, homestead, or right of way at his claim location. Odder still, there is no record of his death. \n",

      " \"\"FLANDERS GROVE\"\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometime between 1826 and 1830, a man by the name of William Vince of Vince’s Bayou, Harrisburg County, acquired the Clear Creek land. On several early maps of Galveston Bay dating back to that time period, the name “Flanders Grove” or “Flanders Labor” appears in the vicinity of the present day town of Kemah, at the mouth of Clear Lake. The place-name has ties to a New Hampshire native by the name of John Flanders. John was the son of Levi and Mary (Sargent) Flanders and was born in Salisbury, Massachusetts. John had been in business with his father in New Hampshire. No record exists concerning the nature of business John and his father owned, although apparently at least a part of the business they conducted dealt in real estate. In the time immediately prior to John's move to the Texas territory, he and his father had a disagreement over a mortgage held by John on a piece of property owned by a widow. John wished to foreclose and his father opposed it. The disagreement developed into bad feelings and John left home, never communicating with his family thereafter.\n",
      "\n",
      "John Flanders was issued a passport for six months on December 7, 1830, in Austin’s colony. A notation in Austin’s Register of Families reads, “Flanders is to be included as a colonist although he takes no land.” Flanders, a 32-year-old  single farmer at the time, had arrived in the Galveston Bay region in mid to late December 1930. It is believed that his first place of residence was in Anahuac, Texas, on the northern tip of Galveston Bay. There, he acquired a house and a lot. However, he was not listed on the 1834 census of Anahuac and it is believed that somtime between early 1931 and the time of the 1934 census Flanders made the purchase of William Vince's land. Since the 1934 censuse does not record Flanders' name as a resident of Anahuac, it is reasonable to assume that he was probably living on his Clear Creek property by that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly enough, John Flanders was listed among the dead at the Alamo. He was one of thirty-two men, commanded by Captain George Kimball, who entered the Alamo on March 1, from Gonzales. Why he was with the men from Gonzales is unknown. Flanders was a Private under Kimball, 36 years old at the time of the Alamo seige, and still unmarried.\n",
      "\n",
      " THE MYSTERY HEIRS \n",
      "\n",
      "With John Flander's death came some interesting and mysterious dealings concerning his estate that, of course, included the \"\"Flanders Grove\"\"/\"\"Flanders Labor\"\" tract. In 1841, Allen Vince, brother of the now-deceased William Vince and resident of Vince’s Bayou, Harris County, was named administrator of the John Flanders estate. The estate was said to consist of only the labor of land at the mouth of Clear Creek on the Southwest side. A petition for sale of the land, to satisfy debts, was requested May 28, 1844. The deceased Vince owed money for lawyer fees (in the case of Sawyer vs Vince in District Court). The land was appraised at $2.00 per acre and sold to Jonathan D. Waters on July 2, 1844 for $354.00. This transaction leaves open the questions of whether or not Flanders still owed William Vince any monies for the land purchase, and how much legal right Allen Vince had to sell the land and use the revenues to pay of a debt on behalf of his brother's estate, instead of keeping the Flanders estate intact.\n",

That is exactly why the unified approach was proposed, and accepted. That a small group of editors attempted to override that in one category is improper because it leads to inconsistency and violation of neutral treatment of subjects. Thus, I think those who want to change the longstanding consensus should start and frame the RFC, and I ask you again to reconsider your close (which also, fwiw, does not deal with biographies of dead people).

      "Regarding you two non-Urantia Book reading nerds - Wazronk and Richiar - if you play games with what you don't know, then you're in for a fight. First of all, you two idiots, if you even bothered to look at the Urantia Readers-Intl website, you would know that it is not an advertising site, but a legitimate non-profit Urantia organization. Because you are not a member of the Urantia movement, and if you were, we would know who you are, you do not even know the history of the Urantia Readers-Intl - which by the way has a larger dedicated following then either the now falling apart Urantia Book Fellowship, and the failing Urantia Association International. \n",
      "\n",
      "For your edification, the Urantia Readers-Intl is the original Urantia Brotherhood from 1950, and the only group still holding the flame of the original Doctrine of Trust from its creation. The Urantia Book Fellowship created itself in 1989 as it broke off from the Urantia Brotherhood and the Urantia Foundation. The Foundation created another group called the Urantia Association International for some ridiculous reason, because they had the legal rights to the Urantia Brotherhood organization, and still do. Nevertheless, the Urantia Association International, as in the same direction as the Urantia Book Fellowship, fell into bad management and nefarious direction, and lost sight of the original Midwayer mandates. As such, the true remaining \"\"loyalist\"\" migrated from the Urantia Brotherhood to the Urantia Association International. \n",
      "\n",
      "Over time the Urantia Association International, because of lack of true sagacity, was infiltrated by members of the rebel Urantia Book Fellowship organization. As such, the \"\"loyalist\"\" members to the Urantia movement, many of whom where members of the Urantia Association of Florida, grabbed the torch and reorganized the original Urantia Brotherhood as the Urantia Readers-Intl. Because you two dummies are not a direct part of the Urantia movement, and again we say this because we would know who you are if you were - you do not know who is who and what is what. You don't even know that the Urantia Book Fellowship is a counter Urantia movement organization. But, you are obviously not true thinkers, but that is not the issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "The issue is that you two jerks keep deleting our external link from this section. We never deleted your links to the Urantia Book Fellowship, but added are link, not apparent to what place it was, but over and over we find it deleted, so now we have game on... you delete us, we delete you. So, if you put the Urantia Book Fellowship link back in, and keep ours in, the we keep yours in. Because you've pissed us off, if you place the Urantia Book Fellowship link above us, we will place our link above you. This is in retrospect to your piousness. So suffer with it. That's life, and perhaps maybe one of you two idiots will someday realize who the Urantia Readers-Intl really is, who the Urantia Book Fellowship really is, and who is the original group with the original doctrine - but we already know that you two bozos don't have what it takes to figure this out in this life time. The truce is... Urantia Readers-Intl first, Urantia Book Fellowship second, Urantia Association International third... at least for now, then maybe someday we'll swap order, just to appease the dark side. But for now this better be it, or we're going to go back and forth with you wimps and beat you at your own game. Capishe?  02:53, 29\"\n",

I don't expect to be treated any differently than anyone else, but I can dish out the same bitter fruits that I am served. Your link shows a socio-path who is so consummed with himself, that he has to denegrate others to put himself in high esteem to himself, because he either has a compulsion he cannot control or he actually gets satisfaction from upsetting the targets he picks. The fact that you would expose yourself by listing such an area of complaints you have received, with utter pride and satisfaction, is not beyond a borderline personality who likes to pick on someone because they know it irritates them. Like a court yard bully, you antagonize someone until they confront you back, then you run to an authority figure to complain about the other person's behavior. Others have pointed similar things out in the link and your response has been overwhelmingly sarcastic. You take pride in being an ex-Communist, you love it when \"\"idiots\"\" from America criticize Nazi's because no one knows who they really were! I could go on and on about your user page, but the point is this! You need help resolving your inability to stop irritating people.

I always try to check before I create a new article that it hasn't been done before, but googling the site first (and also double-checking in the categories) seems to be the best way to do it. The good news is you could easily merge your list into the pre-existing ones and raise their quality. By keeping the lists focused on one topic, it would also be possible to illustrate every single insignia (so long as there is a photo on Wikipedia or Commons somewhere). Like I said, the list you produced was fundamentally of \"\"featurable\"\" quality (possibly with a little bit of work, but not much) and there are plenty of lists on Wikipedia that are of very low quality yet are inherently featurable if they got a little bit of TLC. You seem to have the skills to do that... so if you want to do some \"\"rescue\"\" missions, there's definitely a job there for you with a rather nice reward at the end.

On Wikipedia pages, we use China, Laos, Palestine, Iran, etc. when those are NOT the official IOC designations.  Not only are those now the official names, those are not even the official IOC designations.  Yet, we still use them without question.  It is only with the situation of Taiwan that you make an issue of it.  I am not even proposing the sole use of Taiwan, just it's mention as a parenthetical.  Otherwise, I insist that you use People's Republic of China, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Islamic Republic of Iran, Palestinian Authority, ETC. as those are the IOC designations for those countries.  THAT is where your hypocrisy lies.\n",
      "Rebskii - People SEE Chinese Taipei, but they don't know it is Taiwan.  Why do you think one of Taiwan's gold medal winners had to declare before the international press in Athens, in English, \"\"I am from Taiwan.\"\"?  It is because there is much confusion among people.  I spoke with a couple of Australian baseball fans who made the trip from Australia to see the 2006 Intercontinental Cup here in Taichung.  They didn't know that Chinese Taipei was in fact Taiwan until they started making plans for the trip.  It is not even universally known among sports fans, much less the general public.\n",
      "As for the domains of Taiwan, Orchid Island and Green Island, among others, are historically linked with Taiwan and have long been administratively a part of Taiwan.  The only counties that are not historically part of Taiwan are the tiny islands with some 10,000 people off the coast of Fujian which produces none of our athletes.  Taiwan is the commonly used phrase on the street domestically, not ROC and not Chinese Taipei.\n",

Simply stating Chinese Taipei does not meet that standard because few people know what it is.  A simple parenthetical (Taiwan) beside Chinese Taipei accomplishes one of the standards of good article writing with very little trouble.\n",

The use of 'lay pastor' as cited above (factually), or 'lay preacher' would accurately describe this. 'reverend' as i suggested earlier is simply a polite title which Mr Stanton has been given on numerous occasions, which does not indicate a level of authority within a church body, and could also be used.\n",

But as someone who has grown up on the reservations of South Dakota and who pays attention to the world at large I think this is a very biased article.  Everyone is discussing AIM's side and the role of the government in the incident but no one is putting in the view points of the actual residents of South Dakota.  I am not native but many of my friends and family are.  I see AIM in the same way as I assume many people in a variety of countries see their uprising residents on the national news.  The citizens screaming and calling for justice may not be speaking for the population as a whole; but they are the ones that make the news.  I think before you guys make opinions based on what the media tells you; you should find out if the average tribal member agrees with Russel Means or Leonard Peltier.  You should also research how much time they actually spent on the reservation.  Again I am no expert but from what I know growing up here is that AIM and many others like them were extreme liberals that were not necessarily speaking for the society at large.  I just feel that this is similiar as basing views of the Muslim world based on the extremest you see on TV.

      " imho, activity diagrams are one of the diagrams provided by the UML which is an OMG standard, not related to Utrecht university definition, though it may seem similar on the surface. But there are many variants of these diagrams (e.g. workflow diagrams, workflow nets and even some dialects of Business process modeling are graphically similar) the definition given here is not 'activity diagrams' which is sort of a reserved keyword for the definition of OMG. So, moving the text to Process-data diagram seems a very good idea and would satisfy me fully. Or even leaving it where it is in metadata modeling if that is the term they use to refer to this kind of models, and removing the redundant text from metamodeling page as I initially suggested (hmm, took out my hatchet and did it!). I think what went wrong is the interpretation of the discussion at the top of this discussion page: people were complaining that metamodeling page was polluted by Utrecht definition of the term, and that by 'squatting' the term, some information on the more generally accepted definition of the term ended up on this [metamodeling technique] page. But I think the more generally useful info was extracted from that page already. The merge was suggested as a way of providing an example \"\"provided it is very clear this is not the definition of metamodeling\"\". To conclude if the page metadata modeling contains the description of this modeling formalism, I suggest we cut it from the text of this page, and maybe just add a \"\"see also\"\" pointing to the other page.

When hunting vandalism, blank edit summaries are an indicator of vandalism.  It's always a good idea to add an edit summary to explain to other editors what you've edited and why you edited it.  (3)  Adding your perspective, or indeed any perspective without citation is generally frowned upon.  All 'facts' should be backed up by verifiable sources.

      "I think the discussion is perhaps obscuring the meaning of the concept of Taṇhā, which seems more like the impulse towards an object, rather than desire itself. Without desire, we would not eat or drink, and thus cease to be... without desire, as the Dalai Lama has said, there would be no idea of a path, or anyone trying to follow one (more abstract notions of there being no path aside). Taṇhā is therefore it's own thing, without specific translation in this context, but which we all struggle with every moment. That impulse to obtain or avoid which occurs, and which is attempted to be fulfilled blindly by those remaining in delusion. So although Taṇhā is linked with desire, it is not desire, nor the object of any desire.. it is that momentary impulse that drives us towards a desire. If we then form our intention around that desire, we make ourselves vulnerable to frustration and anxiety. If, on the other hand, we form intention based upon none of these things, and Taṇhā is acknowledged but not acted upon, then we are less vulnerable.\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, I managed to get the highest possible mark in that subject, so that compensated for some weaker marks, and I managed to enter University without much pressure, so thanks again. Anyway, I was recently surfing the web and I came across this image: http://kronosaurus82.deviantart.com/art/Biggest-Ugliest-Baddest-140881861 As you can see, the animals that appear in it are the same as in the size chart you made, however, we can see some discrepances in their height. So, my question is, is this reconstruction correct in this regard? Tyrannosaurids having longer leg bones that Allosauroids and Spinosaurids (and the latter having a lower profile that other theropods) is pretty common knowledge, and longer leg bones mean more height, but, still, the mounted skeleton of Sue is not that much taller that mounted Giganotosaurus, if I recall correctly, and the mount of Spinosaurus is quite massive...\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, about Dromaeosaurs, do you have any idea about the environment Deinonychus and Utahraptor lived in? I ask, mainly, because of the whole feather density (or oven presence, in some cases, it seems), and, after seeing how you reconstructed Achillobator, and the reasoning behind the ratite feathering you gave it, I've been pondering how that could affect medium-large dromaeosaurs in less arid climates.\n",

I mainly need it to driving a point straight home (not like it is that needed, the paper that describes the quill knobs on that genus is pretty good evidence for wings, but, still...). Again, if you have time. In any case, Deinonychus' height would be slighty higher if it adopted a more natural position that the crouching (or as so I see it, correct me if needed) one it is displaying in the chart. Also, do you think Aepyornis would be heavier that Utahraptor? Seeing that the model for estimating weights was deemed somewhat flawed, and that, at least in the chart, Aepyornis has a larger body, well, yeah...\n",
      "\n",
      "By the way, I like how you classified Oviraptorosaurs as an order of Aves, and Deinonychosaurs as part of Archaeopterygiformes. It, well, makes sense, that classification should get more standariced. One tends to forget about those things when thinking in a cladistic way, but, that update would be something needed to change the overall image of those animals. I may start writting them in that way, well, when I get my licenciature and start doing actual work and research in place of preparing exams.

      "The subject homophobia and the definition of the term homophobia are not the same thing. The subject of homophobia is (in short) the fear or hatred of gays, or discrimination or prejudice against them. The AFA is a recognized part of a body of groups, people, and ideas that define modern-day homophobia. There's no way you can deny that, even if you believe that the label is undeserved, that the label could be pejorative in a non-encyclopedic context, or that somehow being categorized under \"\"homophobia\"\" and being an organization somehow equates to being categorized as \"\"homophobic organization.\"\" The categories \"\"homophobic organization\"\" and \"\"homophobe\"\" were deleted because they are, grammatically, constructed to specifically modify or describe the subject in question. \"\"Homophobia\"\" is not, and these false analogies may make it seem like we're out go get the AFA, but we aren't. Although Sam seems to think it's an irrelevant personal comment, it is the case, Hal, that since you got here, you've been arguing that the AFA's opinion of itself should more of a part of the article, and that criticism should not be. Miles have been spun about how much of a big deal this is, that we're gay activists, that we're creating attack articles, that the category homophobia is a pejorative attack on whatever it labels. Now, Sam, I know you'll insist on removing this part of my comment (editing/censoring others' comments is a practice that is, by the way, fairly dubious). But remember that we are supposed to discuss the issue at hand, not the character of others - I'm not attacking Hal's character. But his history of editing for the sake of the AFA is completely relevant to this discussion and a part of the issue at hand - it explains why he believes we've constructed an attack article (hardly), why the category is a pejorative attack or accusation (clearly not), and why it must be eventually removed. I agree with Hal: it could be taken as a pejorative, and what concerns me is that it is, but only (as far as I can tell) by someone who's made it clear that portraying the AFA in a positive light is very important (no matter [[WP:UNDUE|what that entails).  \"\n",

Back in the real world - see all that evidence on Wikipediocracy - I've been trying to post that here from day one, because I came up with it. The reason why you can't see it anywhere here, is because corrupt bastards like Future know that for every Wikipedian who has a clue, there's plenty who are as retarded as you, and will believe him when he says it never existed, and that I'm a troll.

I have restored the list of locations, and we are discussing it on its talk page. Could you please take a look? If you have time, please also look at List of characters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and Smithy Gang. Thanks!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars has two lists pertaining to it (List of characters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, and List of locations in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars). User:TTN decided it would be best to merge the lists into the main article and split Smithy Gang into those articles. I recently merged Smithy Gang into the list of chatacters by removing the non-notable characters, and I have asserted that a cameo section in the list of characters is valid, per Wikipedia:Trivia sections and Wikipedia:Handling trivia that uses Alex Trebek#Cameos as a good example. I have suggested that we rename the articles per Wikipedia:Requested moves#Requesting potentially controversial moves to something along the lines of Characters of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and World of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars or Mushroom Kingdom (Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars) just like Characters of Final Fantasy VIII and World of Final Fantasy VI or Gaia (Final Fantasy VII). I believe if these articles are to evolve beyond a non-notable list, they should be renamed. For example, List of Final Fantasy VII locations was merged into Gaia (Final Fantasy VII), because a World article is notable, but a simple list of locations is not. That is why there are other secions of the article to make it a World article. It simply has not been renamed yet.\n",

      "TTN believes the citations in the development and reception sections of the list of locations, books and magazines, are trivial sources. When I added that the 3D perspective of the game is reminicent of Equinox to the main article, TTN removed it since my souce was \"\"the opinions of the Nintendo Power player's guide writers\"\". Although it was actually Nintendo Power magazine, I do believe a magazine is a reliable source, and I gave a page from Next Generation Magazine which also said the same thing. In addition, I was surprized that TTN said that it was from the players guide, since he claims to own the players guide for the game. He has not verified this, since I asked him for citations in May, \"\"Could you look in the back of the Player's Guide and tell me what “types” of … Magic? I forgot what they call it in the game … well, anyways, what types of Special Attack or whatever it is (actually, could you find out what it's called?) there are? I remember some vaguely when I owned the guide like “Fire”, “Jump”, “Electricity?”, etc. Could you provide a citation, like the page number with a quote in context?\"\" TTN replied that he was going to \"\"get to it\"\" (User talk:TTN/Archive 5#List of locations in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars). TTN claims the player's guide is \"\"at the bottom of a box that's behind at least five others in a cramped space\"\". Seeing that TTN did not recognize that the page was not from the player's guide when I provided a scan of the page in question from Nintendo Power shocked me. However, I have continued to assume good faith by not questioning TTN's honesty.\n",

      "I'm highly amazed by the fact that this debate rages on. If I may interject, Aleta formed a subsection entitled Arbitrary Page Break. Note using the word Arbitrary over say, Random? Are we going to throw a huge fuss over the inclusion of a more sophisticated word? Sobriquet is quite clearly at least somewhat different from Nickname, otherwise there would be only one article encompassing both words. My suggestion is per a growing trend on Wikipedia: Link sobriquet to a definition in Wiktionary, should one exist. This saves readers the hassle of going through an entire article trying to summarily grasp the full definition of one word within an article comprised of several thousand such words. Furthermore, if Wikipedia is meant to be an informal learning tool of sorts, why fear incorporating a higher grade-level vocabulary into it as a means of providing the best possible learning experience? And if we have to \"\"dumb down\"\" a word here, the same precedent would theoretically have to be set for the entire English Wikipedia, thereby degrading the quality of articles. As someone pointed out, if readers cannot grasp the lingusitics of the standard English wikipedia, there's Simple English to cater to that need. So, that's my offer for a solution. Dictionaries are as important of a resource as an encyclopedia and complement one another: Get the information you want and if you don't know what a word means, just look it up.\n",

      "\n",
      "In addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: \"\"Chapter 14: \"\"The Ends of the Universe,\"\" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here\"\". Whereas the version before was properly cited: \"\"David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: \"\"The Ends of the Universe,\"\" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an \"\"eminent physicist\"\" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, while Jeffro77's \"\"fringe\"\" claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an \"\"eminent physicist\"\" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.\n",

      "As well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, \"\"The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,\"\" Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals). The Wikipedia article on the Omega Point Theory lists seven different mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journals in which Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been published (and that's not including the Zygon journal).

In that context, a medical student is an \"\"undergraduate\"\" because he or she has not graduated from the MD program.  However, that does not mean that an MD is an \"\"undergraduate degree\"\" as that term is usually understood in the US.  That term is reserved for bachelor degrees; any program (such as medical school or law school) which is generally attained after four-year college is called a \"\"graduate program\"\", and the degrees it grants are \"\"graduate degrees\"\".\n",

      "I now think that the Proto-Indo-Europeans lived in present-day Turkey.  Yet the Kurgan culture does play an important role in the evolution of Indo-European languages.  I think it was founded by Indo-Europeans which immigrated to the Pontic steppe.  The ones which did not leave were cultural ancestors of the speakers of Anatolian languages.  The language of the Kurgan culture gave rise to all other Indo-European languages.  These include all the ones spoken today.\n",

      "\n",
      "A larger splinter group from Kurgan culture was the Beaker people.  This metalworking pastoral people spread over much of Europe.  The areas were they settled includes almost all of West-Central Europe, the Italian and Iberian Peninsulas, the large islands between them, the British Islands, Southern Scandinavia and probably parts of Eastern Europe north of the grasslands.  With such a widespread culture they soon developed several different languages.  These were ancestral of the Baltic, Slavic, Germanic, Celtic and Italic (including Romatic) ones.\n",

      "The Kurgan people themselves developed into the Proto-Indo-Iranians, many of which returned to the Middle East.

While we take no position on whether such forces exist, they are simply not testable by scientific means and therefore cannot qualify as part of the scientific process or as a scientific theory.\n",

      "Intelligent design (ID) is an anti-evolution belief asserting that naturalistic explanations of some biological entities are not possible and such entities can only be explained by intelligent causes.*  Advocates of ID maintain that their belief is scientific and provides empirical proof for the existence of God or superintelligent aliens. They claim that intelligent design should be taught in the science classroom as an alternative to the science of evolution. ID is essentially a hoax, however, since evolution is consistent with a belief in an intelligent designer of the universe and with an unlimited number of other metaphysical myths.\n",

      "Essentially, most neo-creationists (among whom there is quite a bit of variation) do not believe in a young Earth, accept micro-evolution (though recently so do some classical creationists), don't believe in the literal truth of the Bible, and don't even call themselves creationists - the preferred term for their version of things is \"\"intelligent design\"\"\n",

They're supposed to be parallel to \"\"People from Whatcom County\"\" or \"\"People from Oxfordshire\"\" but the reality is that regional districts are not anything like counties are, especially not in terms of any self-referential \"\"this is where I'm from sense\"\".  Unless you mean all \"\"people from XXX\"\" categories....in the case of regional districts, which have only existed since 1867-1968 and also do not include Indian Reserves in their governance, and have extremely limited powers (sewer, zoning, some planning and disaster management), they're not relevant to historical figures or anything to do with Indian Reserves or people from them; some users, like User:Backspace, and I, got into something like edit wars over his/her labelling objects like mountains, lakes, etc with them, and similarly provincial parks are not managed or classified by them in any way (different branch of the governance system, namely Ministry of Environment); there's also, y'see, Forest Districts and Forest Regions, Land Districts (which are the legal subdivisions but without governmental relevance of any kind), Ministry of Environment Regions (for parks theoretically but BC Parks, has its own system within MoE), Health Regions (hospitals, etc), School Districts, \"\"Counties\"\" (which are for the court system but largely irrelevant to daily life), Development Regions (which ARE relevant to daily life and provincially-kept statistics, though tey're formed from aglloomerations/boundaries of regional districts but separate from them administratively), and BC Tourism (http://www.hellobc.com) has its OWN system of regions.  The rationale provided by the regional district categories-defenders is that because it's the system that StatsCan uses to divvy up BC for the census, i.e. counting people, then it \"\"makes sense\"\" to use them as geographic subdivisions for \"\"where people are from\"\".  But it just doesn't make sense....the problem now is that there's all kinds of mirrored wiki-clones which ahve statments like \"\"XXX Mountain is a mountain in the such-and-so regional district\"\", though the more relevant reference is \"\"in the such-and-so mountain range\"\" or \"\"in the xxx Country/Valley\"\" (in BC there's lots of historical region-references of the \"\"Nicola Country\"\", \"\"Shuswap Country\"\", \"\"Omineca Country\"\" type, sometimes capitalized, though often not, and often just \"\"the Shuswap\"\", \"\"the Okanagan\"\", \"\"the Omineca\"\" etc, and regional district names, and also electoral district names, are often \"\"built out of them\"\", e.g. Columbia-Shuswap, Okanagan-Similkameen; but I've also seen translated categories/articles saying \"\"Fraser Valley\"\" when meaning the Fraser Valley Regional District; the problem is that only half of the Fraser Valley is even IN the regional district of that name (the rest is in the Greater Vancouver one), and similarly the Cariboo Regional District doesn't include all of the Cariboo, and itself includes a region known as the Chilcotin.  I've created categories for most of those areas, and a parallel hierachy for same, but have been challenged about that because their precise boundaries can't be cited easily; even though they're what people actually use and historically pre-date even the province itself.......there's some subcategories using that format e.g. Category:People from the Similkameen (where \"\"the Similkameen\"\" = \"\"the Similkameen Country\"\" and also Category:Cariboo people, although that's largely intended for historical figures from that region's glory days during the Cariboo Gold Rush and since.  In the way British Columbians actually talk, \"\"so-and-so is from the Thompson-Nicola Regional District\"\" would mean that that person WORKS for the Thompson-Nicola Regional District\"\", most likely an official or bylaw enforcement person.  Myself, I'd like to ditch this particular group of categories entirely but have yet to garner consensus for that; the rationale is that some other long-ago Wikipedian created the hierarchy \"\"and so we should respect that\"\", even though that person, to me, was utterly clueless and shouldn't have created them at all.  The only thing the main RD categories should be used for is the component municipalities; though there are some Electoral Areas that have articles; but ti's when those start getting used as geographic descriptors, it's entirely offbase; it's all over Googlemaps and Wikimaps, too, and it's really annoying to see; similarly the use of the French-form of Indian Reserve names has similarly been borrowed and pasted all over hell's half digital acreage because it's what StatsCan (wrongly) uses.  As if StatsCan were the only'' classification system and as if real people talked like bureaucrats in Ottawa do....anyway sorry for the rant, it's been rare for me to find\n",

You said that advisors are stationed in Georgia proper, so it's a Georgian mission. Well done! Xeeron, I get 2.87 million links when I google \"\"South Ossetia War\"\". That's English buddy. If only Xeeron, you read the title \"\"SECURITY COUNCIL HOLDS THIRD EMERGENCY MEETING AS SOUTH OSSETIA CONFLICT INTENSIFIES, EXPANDS TO OTHER PARTS OF GEORGIA\"\" South Ossetia Conflict (War) expands, as in already expanded, it says expands, NOT expanding, or about to expand, therefore, the UN knowingly named the war the [2008] South Ossetia War, KNOWING that it will expand. See how important reading the title, and getting the correct title is? My arguments haven't evaporated anywhere; South Ossetia is still location-based (my initial argument); it is still where over 90% of the fighting took place; it still has the most important battle (Tskhinvali); my arguments are still here buddy. And Xeeron, I have pointed to you countless times that might doesn't make right. Saying the majority says so, does NOT make it NPOV. If you would have lived in the South during the Civil Rights Movenment you'd realize that might doesn't make right, or NPOV for that matter. I've seen your majority view point and called it a farce many times. Grey Fox - I have proof for how the \"\"2008 Georgia War\"\" is biased; it is biased because it IMPLIES that South Ossetia was a De Facto part of Georgia - which as we all know is bullshit, because if a region is De Facto and De Jure part of a country - there is no war! My Russian colleagues may disagree, but Chechnya was not De Facto part of Russia in the 1990's, it was De Jure. And it was called the Second Chechen War, not the Russian War 1999-2006. So in other words Mr. Grey Fox, and the other two of you, you have FAILED to show my how 2008 South Ossetia War is NPOV, but I HAVE shown you, and cited an example of how 2008 Georgia War would be incorrect and biased.

I already gave you a DIRECT quote from the Anime and Manga project MoS, yet you said you still couldn't find it. That was also done after lengthy discussions during our last (and far more recent) MoS upgrade. And sorry, but as I'm actually and active member in TV, Film, and Anime and MoS I don't need to \"\"do research\"\" because I already know, however, let's actually look Category:Lists of television characters and Category:Lists of anime and manga characters and which one do you see as the naming convention used for the bulk of all lists? Let me make it easy: Television main cat has 167 lists, of which 48 use your preferred schema (and most of those are serious AfD bait), 19 follow neither convention with 13 being the Characters in/of variety of non-lists. Anime/Manga, 269 lists, only 13 of which do not use List of X characters, and of those only 4 use your preferred version, 1 uses Characters of, and the rest need renaming/merging/deleting.  Then there is the less populated Category:Lists of film characters with only 57 lists. Of those, again, 27 do not use List of X characters or are not actual lists. Of those 27, 3 use the Characters of/in, 1 uses X characters, and 23 use your preferred List of characters in/of X. So, vast majority of all of those use List of X characters, and most of those that don't aren't lists that their respective projects would even approve of their existance, and if kept as is, would be renamed. So, where is your research to actually show that yours is preferred, except by a single project which also rejects other guidelines. Where is the overall naming guideline that truly supports your claim without special interpretation? And where is your discussions giving consensus to begin renaming any such lists you feel doesn't meet this personal interpretation without any discussion.   (talk · contribs) \n",

In my experience, important points get \"\"lost\"\" in the debate as one side or the other will (sometimes deliberately) drown them out with side-issues. This is why the role of overseer is crucial. The overseer would be required to look out for people doing this and rein them in. In that environment a consensus has a better chance. However, we must have a mechanism by which resolution can be achieved without consensus (in a similar way to ArbCom). Hence, the idea would require an \"\"oversight committee\"\" (to be dubbed \"\"OverCom\"\", no doubt) that would make a \"\"final resort\"\" decision. I suspect that this would usually be in favour of one side or the other, but they should perhaps have the option of saying \"\"neither is right\"\" (or both, to some extent).\n",

      "To be honest, I am not sure I entirely follow. What is exactly is meant by holding a \"\"pro-gay bias\"\"? That I am in favour of homosexuality? This seems entirely nonsensical, and indeed strictly speaking to be \"\"pro-gay\"\" would mean you hold that it is a superior sexual orientation that all should aspire to. To be quite honest, I think the whole notion of a \"\"pro-gay bias\"\" is entirely homophobic, and used to paint those who accept different sexual orientations in a manner that suggests they desire to promote homosexuality. Clearly, the article has a distinctly homophobic bias. It portrays a homosexuality as abnormal and deviant, homosexuality as a \"\"post-industrial\"\" cosmopolitan lifestyle, and homosexuality as the social norm. These are all strongly homophobic POVs which are rejected by those who accept different sexual orientations (i.e., the majority of society in the West, and specifically progressives and social liberals). Those who hold such beliefs are indeed social conservatives who defend traditional morality and particularly heterosexual relationships. Stating the views of social-conservatives as objective facts, without even engaging with the beliefs of the majority of society who accept homosexuality, is clearly and irrefutably extremely biased. As is the implication that homosexuality has supposedly \"\"increased\"\"  as a result of the  \"\"modern urbanity of the post-industrial age\"\", when in fact it is irrefutably due to the increasing acceptance of people's sexualities that has occurred in Western society in the 20th Century. On these grounds, I intend to revert this article.  10:00, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)\"\n",

MONGO made abrupt, final decisions without any discussion, nor without any other editor's input.  He deleted everything I added within minutes, did not leave room for discussion, ignored my Talk page discussion, removed all of my POV templates, did not wait for other editors to take part.  In particular, he removed my 1 sentence 1 source (Outside Magazine) addition to the article, and cited only personal reasons, rather than objective reasons, which is why I did the POV templates.  The reason for blocking me was that I stated he committed \"\"Vandalism\"\".  I stated \"\"potential Vandalism\"\".  I'm new to wikipedia and it seemed he was unilaterally vandalizing a perfectly good 1 sentence and 1 national magazine article.  Seems MONGO was edit warring.

      "Science (from Latin scientia, meaning \"\"knowledge\"\") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about nature and the universe.\"\"... modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by mathematics; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions.\"\"—J. L. Heilbron ( ) In an older and closely related meaning, \"\"science\"\" also refers to a body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied. A practitioner of science is known as a scientist.\n",
      "\n",
      "In modern usage, \"\"science\"\" may refer as well to a way of pursuing or producing knowledge, not only the knowledge itself. Especially in the anglophone world \"\"science\"\" is often restricted to those branches of study that seek to explain the phenomena of the material universe.Oxford English Dictionary The German approach of \"\"Wissenschaften\"\" in the tradition of Humboldtian science and Humboldtian education ideal is more generic and includes all sort of scholarly endeavours with philosophy still as a common denominator. The The Two Cultures the German Positivism dispute and the US science wars refer to ongoing controversies about the role of natural sciences and the humanities. The controversies refered as well to the longstanding dominance of male White Anglo-Saxon Protestant scholars in e.g. US universities and the use of \"\"Dead white European men\"\" as role models. It has lead to various attempts, as in gender studies to involve e.g. female or minority perspectives in science and as well a backslash defending the important role of the classics.Bernard Knox, The Oldest Dead White European Males and Other Reflections on the Classics (1993) (reprint, W.

      "In many places in the article, we make statements which are based not on studies of AS, but rather of studies on people with various sorts of autism. While many researchers consider AS and HFA to be so similar that there is no point in even distinguishing between them, there is at least a significant minority who have championed the continuing existence of AS as a distinct diagnosis. If we treat studies on persons who were diagnosed with autistic disorder as if they had been diagnosed with AS, we implicitly bias the article in favor of the one viewpoint. So, even though I happen to believe that AS and HFA are the same in most important aspects, I intend to go through this article and weed out the bias. AS may not be very well researched, but there is not such a dearth of information that we are compelled to introduce large amounts of material on arguably different topics.\n",

The aims of Wikipedia is to produce a \"\"neutral, reliably sourced encyclopedia\"\". My position is that editors from the rational-skeptic wikiproject and their ilk are NOT neutral in this subject, and in fact are incapable of being neutral because they do not have any hands on empirical experience with acupuncture, no specialist dedicated learning in it, have not taken the time to grapple with the unique and complex paradigm that contextualizes it, and thus their knowledge of it is incomplete and immature, and they are ill-equiped to provide a full, rounded, mature and neutral synthesis of the information available on this topic.\n",

In fact, considering the tone of most editors on the acupuncture talk page, which emulates the tone of those \"\"Quackwatch\"\" websites that proliferate on the web these days, and considering their devoted following of Edzard Ernst and their elevation of his work as the number 1 source on the page (literally), and their transparent agenda of \"\"de-bunking\"\" the \"\"pseudo-science\"\" they consider acupuncture to be, it rather seems to an objective observer that is those editors who are \"\" advancing outside interests\"\" rather than being neutral, and thus they in breach of COI, as opposed to I.  \"\n",

Also you forget the common usage of Arjuna and Yudhistra is Arjun and Yudhistir. However wherever they are mentioned on Wikipedia their Sanskritized names are used. Also the common usage is actually the Hindi version of their names. We can't just change a name because its usage is different in the majority language. Whenever names of Hindu deities or mythological characters are mentioned, Sanskritized names are mostly used. You can see that in all articles about Hnduism on Wikipedia.

The inclusion of the school type (independent), gender (all-girls), and religious information (Catholic) of Holy Name of Mary College School in this article, is meant to illustrate the parallels to the school type (private), gender (all-boys), and religious information (Catholic) of St. Michael's College School.174.89.27.124  \n",

      " NASA Study Debunks Part of Global Warming \n",
      "NASA Sees Arctic Ocean Circulation Do an About-Face\n",
      "November 13, 2007\n",
      "\n",
      "PASADENA, Calif. – A team of NASA and university scientists has detected an ongoing reversal in Arctic Ocean circulation triggered by atmospheric circulation changes that vary on decade-long time scales. The results suggest not all the large changes seen in Arctic climate in recent years are a result of long-term trends associated with global warming.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team, led by James Morison of the University of Washington's Polar Science Center Applied Physics Laboratory, Seattle, used data from an Earth-observing satellite and from deep-sea pressure gauges to monitor Arctic Ocean circulation from 2002 to 2006. They measured changes in the weight of columns of Arctic Ocean water, from the surface to the ocean bottom. That weight is influenced by factors such as the height of the ocean's surface, and its salinity. A saltier ocean is heavier and circulates differently than one with less salt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very precise deep-sea gauges were developed with help from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; the satellite is NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace). The team of scientists found a 10-millibar decrease in water pressure at the bottom of the ocean at the North Pole between 2002 and 2006, equal to removing the weight of 10 centimeters (four inches) of water from the ocean. The distribution and size of the decrease suggest that Arctic Ocean circulation changed from the counterclockwise pattern it exhibited in the 1990s to the clockwise pattern that was dominant prior to 1990.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reporting in Geophysical Research Letters, the authors attribute the reversal to a weakened Arctic Oscillation, a major atmospheric circulation pattern in the northern hemisphere. The weakening reduced the salinity of the upper ocean near the North Pole, decreasing its weight and changing its circulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Our study confirms many changes seen in upper Arctic Ocean circulation in the 1990s were mostly decadal in nature, rather than trends caused by global warming,\"\" said Morison.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"While some 1990s climate trends, such as declines in Arctic sea ice extent, have continued, these results suggest at least for the 'wet' part of the Arctic  the Arctic Ocean  circulation reverted to conditions like those prevalent before the 1990s,\"\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arctic Oscillation was fairly stable until about 1970, but then varied on more or less decadal time scales, with signs of an underlying upward trend, until the late 1990s, when it again stabilized. During its strong counterclockwise phase in the 1990s, the Arctic environment changed markedly, with the upper Arctic Ocean undergoing major changes that persisted into this century. Many scientists viewed the changes as evidence of an ongoing climate shift, raising concerns about the effects of global warming on the Arctic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morison said data gathered by Grace and the bottom pressure gauges since publication of the paper earlier this year highlight how short-lived the ocean circulation changes can be. The newer data indicate the bottom pressure has increased back toward its 2002 level. \"\"The winter of 2006-2007 was another high Arctic Oscillation year and summer sea ice extent reached a new minimum,\"\" he said. \"\"It is too early to say, but it looks as though the Arctic Ocean is ready to start swinging back to the counterclockwise circulation pattern of the 1990s again.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Morison cautioned that while the recent decadal-scale changes in the circulation of the Arctic Ocean may not appear to be directly tied to global warming, most climate models predict the Arctic Oscillation will become even more strongly counterclockwise in the future. \"\"The events of the 1990s may well be a preview of how the Arctic will respond over longer periods of time in a warming world,\"\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace monitors tiny month-to-month changes in Earth's gravity field caused primarily by the movement of water in Earth's land, ocean, ice and atmosphere reservoirs. As such it can infer changes in the weight of columns of ocean water. In contrast, the pressure gauges installed on the sea floor in 2005-2006 directly measured water pressure at the bottom of the ocean. Gauge data were remotely recovered during the first year of the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"The close agreement between the North Pole pressure gauges and Grace data demonstrates Grace's potential for tracking world ocean circulation,\"\" said study co-author John Wahr of the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Satellite altimeters, such as NASA's Jason, are ideal for studying ocean circulation but can't be used at Earth's poles due to ice cover,\"\" said study co-author Ron Kwok of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"\"Our results show Grace can be a powerful tool for trac\n",

      "I have been an observer of this article on Abbas Babei since the start of this conflict. I want to point out that we this issue needs to be solved otherwise both users will face blocks. Hooperag has offered a proposal that makes logical sense, Imagine this was the article of Barack Obama, we can't just say: \"\"Obama is notorious for his merciless treatment towards the minters of parliament who oppose his policies\"\" (that's a totally random example, but whatever). It is more appropriate that if you wish to include a subjective statement like \"\"Babaei was \"\"notorious for his merciless treatment of the pilots and officers\"\" considered disloyal to the new regime\"\", you include some background info on who made that statement (add more context). The word \"\"merciless\"\" is very subjective (opinion based) and if it is to be used you can't use it as if it was fact based, when you say \"\"Babaei was notorious for his merciless treatment of the pilots and officers\"\" you are making a strong statement about him that makes it seem as if it is a 100% true fact that he was merciless.\n",
      " For these reasons I suggest we rephrase the sentence to be something along the lines of Hooperag's suggestion whish was to rephrase it something like this: \"\"According to the famous historian Tom Cooper whom interviewed various Iranian pilots, Abbas Babaei was considered \"\"merciless\"\" in his treatment towards pilots disloyal to the new regime\"\".\n",

There's a certain lexical irony/injustice in the French translation, too, because the \"\"Columbia\"\" part of the name comes from the river (via the fur district named after it), not the country (i.e. Columbia as the poetic name for the US, with nothing to do with Colombia except the shared namesake); the river got its name not from the poetic name of the US, but from Capt. Gray's ship The Columbia, which was the first to enter and sail up the river (so 'tis claimed); and the ship was named for the US, by way of its poetic name.  Confusing, huh?  Yeah, but the upshot is that in French the name of the river is la fleuve Columbia, but they insist that BC's name in French should be la colombie-brittanique i.e. from la colombie, which is the name for the South American country.  This is not just bad history of course, it's downright incorrect; The Columbia portion of the We are expected to use accents on Montreal and Quebec when writing English; they can't even be bothered to get our name, and its history, right.  \"\"They\"\" includes me, by the way, as I'm 1/4 Franco-canadien and, for someone born in BC, speak it pretty well (from my own initiative, not from family background).  Anyway, in a historical/lexical sense the French name SHOULD be la colombia-britannique\"\"; the clincher would be in any historical French-language HBC or NWC documents referring to the Columbia Fur District in French, i.e. as to which form they used; not that anybody in l'office de la langue francaise or the academie francaise'' gives a ****.

It is about Lucien Cramp (Kath Soucie) and Wayne Cramp (Tom Kenny), not-so identical twins who live with their hygiene-obsessed mother (Nicole Oliver) and their Western-obsessed father (Ian James Corlett) in the fictional town of Soap City. Wayne and Lucian's personalities clash, and they rarely get along. Wayne has a friend called Dirty Joe (Lee Tockar), who owns a dump, and neighbour Wendy Winkle (Reverend Andrew Sparks) has a crush on him, but he hates her. Wayne's and Lucien's teacher is Miss. Hillary Hissy (Demi Buchanan, who also plays Tony's mom Lily and Mrs. Winkle). Lucien's friends include environment-friendly Tony Parsons (Terry Klassen who also plays Tony's dad, Seth) and Mari and Luke Harrison (Adam Little).\n",

Gentle and sensitive, Lucien is frequently bullied and name-called by his brother; Wayne's favourite choice of addressing Lucien is \"\"Girlpants\"\", but he sometimes calls Lucien a \"\"nerd\"\". Lucien enjoys science, nature and is a vegetarian. Lucian longs for a pet, but due to his mother's extreme cleaniliness rules, he is denied owning any.  Secretly, Lucien keeps a worm farm under his bed, that only Tony, Mari, Wayne and Wendy know about. It is shown in many episodes that Lucien has a fear of clowns. He has many skills, including knitting, and has shown interest in playing the harp. Lucien likes going to Soap City's only swamp (the only place he gets peace from Wayne, who is afraid of the place) where Tony lives. Lucien is technically the older twin as he was born first in the opening credits. Lucien Cramp is voiced by Kath Soucie. \n",
      " Wayne Archibald Cramp is the blue-skinned antihero of the series. He is taller, destructive, and the less intelligent of the twins. Wayne is obsessed with junk, which he collects and hides in his room; he spends most of his time at the junkyard, owned by only friend, Dirty Joe. Unlike Lucien, who loves the swamp, Wayne is terrified of the place, and also has a fear of frogs. Wayne is constantly annoyed by Wendy Winkle who has a crush on him. Wayne's only love is anything sugary, his main source of energy, and if he is deprived from it, he becomes tired and speaks nonsense. Wayne likes to give the impression that he's the best-behaved of the twins to his mother, and sometimes Miss Hissy, but in truth, he likes to manipulate to achieve his goals.

Fore example say you live in Vancouver, BC and you work at any minimum wage job8.00/hr, which after taxes nets you $1,000/mo. Ohby the way a studio flat here costs $1,000/mo. so hope you have a trust fund to draw upon if you are paid anywhere near minimum wage in BC. Mountains here are nice though! I'm sure they're trying to figure out a way to charge us all for looking at them...we should have to pay a corporation for this privilege, shouldn't we? Yes, most definitely!\n",

I've run into similar problems elsewhere, where a few works are cited many times, and it's useful to collect the the full citations into a section, and to have the footnotes cite these works in abbreviated form. In Daylight saving time I addressed the problem by moving those books into the Further reading section, which isn't exactly appropriate, as Further reading is supposed to be for books that weren't used as sources; I attempted to work around the problem by having the first footnote mention the existence of the full citations in the Further reading section. In Philitas of Cos I addressed it by renaming the section that is ordinarily called References to Notes and having a new References section containing the list of full citations; but it's a bit weird and non-uniform to have the section title move to the newly-added section when you need the new section. I vaguely recall seeing an list-of-full-citations section called Bibliography in some other article but that's not appropriate either, as the MOS says that Bibliography is for works written by the subject of the article. I don't know of any useful guideline in Wikipedia in this problematic area. The approach currently taken in Tourette syndrome #References isn't clearly wrong, and is arguably better than what's in Daylight saving time or in Philitas of Cos, not only because it doesn't abuse Further reading and References as titles, but also because it puts the most important references first.\n",

Then be sure the source does support both facts. Otherwise, readers will be misled. If that source does not actually support the second fact, you should find a source for the second fact or preserve the original source and place or edit it so that readers will know which fact is supported by which source. If a fact does not have a source cited for it, the fact can be challenged, edited, or deleted by any editor (the exception being, as Wikipedians sometimes say, that no source is needed for the fact that \"\"the sky is blue\"\", or for any fact not likely to be challenged).

Almost universally (including me), these scientists when presented with current CF papers or statements say \"\"What? I thought that was over.\"\"  A very few are aware it is not, most of them are somewhat incensed that CF is NOT dead, and, at this point, only one (me) has actually studied the field and published conventional explanations (the other, W. B. Clarke, passed away).  This situation has allowed the CF die-hards to experience a resurgence of their view in the popular press, since not enough informed scientists are available to stop them (which is not a nefarious plot, they just do lousy science and rarely make it through a good peer review) and they actively suppress mention of the outstanding criticisms of their work.

I do believe that what is being stated in the quote improves the article, namely that although bitcoin is not legally banned in terms of Russian law, it is in fact banned by the authorities on a de facto basis. On the other hand it is also true - as implied in the quote - that there may be many millions of USD (it is a big economy) worth of bitcoins present today in Russia on computers owned by Russians since they bought them from and paid for them in Russian Roubles on exchanges accessible to them outside Russia - and that this practice most probably would continue with and equivalent increase in the number and value of bitcoins inside Russia. If the article would have continued to state in two sourced instances only that bitcoin is illegal in Russia, it would have projected the wrong impression that there are no bitcoins in Russia and that bitcoin plays absolutely no role in the Russian economy. I do agree that the section in question deals with the legal status of bitcoin in a country. Embellishing the section with reality improves the article.\n",

They may accept that evolutionary change is possible within animal kinds, which change is referred to as \"\"microevolution\"\", but deny that one animal kind can evolve into another, which change is called \"\"macroevolution\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The terms macroevolution and microevolution as used in mainstream science relate to the same processes operating at different scales, but creationist claims misuse the terms in a vaguely defined way which does not accurately reflect scientific usage, acknowledging well observed evolution as \"\"microevolution\"\" and denying that \"\"macroevolution\"\" takes place.CB902: Microevolution is distinct from macroevolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Darwinists Nicholas Matzke and Paul R. Gross have accused creationists of using \"\"strategically elastic\"\" definitions of micro- and macroevolution when discussing the topic. The actual definition of macroevolution accepted by scientists is \"\"any change at the species level or above\"\" (phyla, group, etc.) and microevolution is \"\"any change below the level of species.\"\" Matzke and Gross state that many creationist critics define macroevolution as something that cannot be attained, as these critics describe any observed evolutionary change as \"\"just microevolution\"\".\n",

Once the airfoil is well inside this body of air (by several chord lengths, say 5 or more), the rate of vertical momentum change of this body of air is equal to the lift. Or more precise: the reaction force of the wing on the air (minus the lift force). At the edges of this body of air, far from the airfoil, nothing is happening. \n",

I have enjoyed immensely Wikisource where, granted, the atmosphere is much friendlier and encouraging, so my editing energies can safely go there.

I don't intend to get involved in the award culture on Wikipedia such  FAC, FAR or other areas where editors are competitively vested in collecting awards.  My first interest is fixing up articles that I would like to link to Wikisource articles, but are in such bad condition that I don't link. Secondly, I would create articles that are needed for explanations for Wikisource articles. I will stay away from any article that belongs to a vested editor, where an editor lists and article under articles \"\"I wrote\"\" or refers to \"\"my articles\"\" in posts. I will make it a practice to check histories for that kind of editor. Outside the FAC/FAR arena there is not much of a problem, I don't think, if any at all.  I have created over 600 articles in a multitude of subjects, mostly to fill in \"\"missing links\"\" on Wikipedia. I will continue with low key endeavors such as that. However, at the sign of any \"\"push back\"\" I will simply not continue editing the article or dealing with that editor, or even editing Wikipedia for a while.

      "Regarding HeartBreaker, The Original Tribute to Pat Benatar, please forgive me for not fully understanding what makes this listed for deletion. Perhaps it's just a guiedlines issue? But, what speciffically makes any of the other tribute bands listed on the tribute act page any more notable than HeartBreaker to allow those pages inclusion? Is it the formatting? Unfortunately, I am new to the Wikipedia environment regarding editing and possibly need some direction on this? I came across the tribute acts pages and noticed The Iron Maidens, which is a local group with not as long a tenure in the tribute community as HeartBreaker, although definately notable, and they are incuded. But beyond The Iron Maidens are bands whos accomplishments pale in comparison to HeartBreaker. HeartBreaker IS a notable, respected and an acknowledged band of the tribute community as well as being one of the first of local tribute acts to appear in the L.A. area when the tribute phenomenon began during the late 90s, particularily with a female lead singer. That, in itself makes HeartBreaker a pioneer to the community. What other information or details do you suggest including, other that what is listed in the biography which is certainly not insignificant, in order to make this page more or as \"\"notable\"\" than or as any of the other other listed tribute bands by Wikipedia standards, and to gain inclusion? Please advise. I have perused some of the other acts' pages linked to the tribute acts page and see only a few with significant notability, most have even fewer accomplishments and notariety than HeartBreaker, some I've never even heard of and certainly aren't known to our local tribute community, which definately expands beyond just the L.A. area. HeartBreaker has been written about and featured in reliable sources and is known for it's tenure, quality and respected within our tribute community, particularily since we are one of the longest running tributes AND are acknowledged BY the artist to whom we pay tribute, Pat Benatar and members of her band(s). We are the only band of any kind listed in her official web pages and have been joined by significant original members of her band. This in itself lends support to the tribute act pages. The histoy of the tribute act pages specifically points to acts who are joined to play with the artists to whom they tribute and further goes on the list bands on the page. Why is it not acceptable to list HeartBreaker and a biography of information to support the tribute act pages? We may not have as much notariety as The Iron Maidens but we certainly are not insignificant and definately are more notable that some of the listed bands. HeartBreaker was featured in a televised documentary about tribute bands on a major network and has been written about and listed is major publications. How can any of this not be notable when this is in regard to tribute bands?????? Please explain. Thank you.\"\n",

This sets a context for these dogs (the matter of fact tone suggests approval of this use of a dog, as does, very much so, that the first requirement for a working dog is that someone should work it!).

Another alternative is to copy and paste (highlight the text you want to copy, hold down \"\"Ctrl\"\" and hit \"\"C\"\" to copy, and then place you cursor where you want to paste the text or character and hold down \"\"Ctrl\"\" again had hit \"\"V\"\". An alternative to using the keyboard is to use the copy and paste commands on the drop-down menu under \"\"Edit\"\" at the top of your browser window.)

      "I rewrote somewhat to avoid a combining of the traditions of different parts of Polynesia. I also tried to change the emphasis in the opening line to Pulotu as 'Polynesian mythology' which gives the mistaken impression that the concept is found all over Polynesia. It is important to maintain the separation of the individual traditions - otherwise we are at risk of rewriting the traditions. The association made with the Māori concepts of Hawaiki and Te Reinga I thought was taking it a little too far - Hawaiki is not always/often conceived of that way by my people. I also took out a reference to 'Purotu' since there was no evidence offered that the word occuring in that form means underworld.

He, more than anyone else, is the most credible person that can publish articles and true informations about Cohanim genetic signatures, not Jheald. He was the one who discovered the CMH in 1997. After 10 years, he came out to announce in 2007, that \"\"he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2\"\". Katz, Kaplan, Rappaport, Shapiro, Kovacs,Konh, are all J2. Those surnames and families are the most prestigious Cohanim families today. They are all Cohanim J2. J2 Cohanim is much more common than J1 Cohanim. \"\"Skorecki reported that Pinchas the zealot mentioned in the Bible may be the origin of J2\"\" This is a very important information that confirms matematical, historic, and genealogy facts. Phinchas was the son of Eleazar. Itamar was his brother. Out of the 24 Cohanim houses, 16 did belong to Eleazar-Pinchas, while only 8 came out from Itamar seed. Eleazar-Pinchas (J2) had a much larger population than Itamar. All Cohanim genealogy were divided into those two houses, until the destruction of the second temple. So, if Phinchas is the origin of all Cohanim J2, than it makes sense, since his Cohanim seed produced much more descendants than his brother Itamar. So, it is very normal and logical to understand why genetic cohanim signatures presents two CMHs wich is the caracteristics of the two houses of Cohanim. All genealogic tree for Cohanim since Aaron until today are still divided into these two houses: Eleazar-Pinchas and Itamar. During the 1270 years of the cohanim services (Mishkan and Mikdash) the Cohanim jews were always selected by the 24 houses. 18 from Pinchas, and only 8 from Itamar.

      "The extended CMH-12 is established for J1 Cohanim only. If somebody in J1 also has CMH-12, then he is likely to have Cohen ancestry. J1 Cohanim form a tight network around CMH-12. But this is not the case for J2. The CMH-12 does not apply to J2. If a J2 is in CMH-12, it tells us nothing about one being a Cohen. In J2, the CMH-12 has no special status. The J1 lineage of Cohanim in CMH-12 could be much more recent.  Jewish Cohanim in J2 form a much larger network around CMH-6  than Jewish Cohanim in J1 do. Cohanim Jews belong mainly to haplogroup J2 because Cohanim as a group (J1,J2) have a high frequency of J2. The J2 Cohanim have much more ancient common ancestor, according to the *observed* mutation rate (which is three times faster than the standard, \"\"effective\"\" rate). J2 Cohanim serves as the deep background of the priestly Jewish caste (J1,J2). “The finding of J2 among contemporary Cohanim can lend credence that today’s Cohanim (J1,J2) may be descendents of two different founding dynasties – including coalescence to Phinchas as the founder of J2 Cohanim” concluded Dr. Karl Skorecki.\n",

      " I'm not pretending anything and what I did is not \"\"mass deletion\"\" - it's replacement of POV material with reliable sources. Before my latest edit, the Shlomo Argov edit did not even make sense - it couldn't, since the latter half of the paragraph that completed the first one was removed and replaced by something unrelated. What's more, all the material inserted by me today - about Israel's casus belli and the UN's commission's finding that Israel was responsible for the massacre - was there before my latest edits and only got removed, possibly by POV-motivated authors, this month. You can see both edits were already there months ago. Both edits are well sourced and, after a cursory look at the editing history, it can be seen whoever removed them did not give an explanation for their actions. The casus belli edit has as a source David Hirst's book about Lebanese history. The book was widely reviewed on mainstream media, and praised. It sits at the top of Wikipedia's reliable source chain. And even though this isn't required, the book is excerpted to show it supports the edit's content. In case anyone's in doubt, several other sources give support to Hirst's narrative. Remove it all you like - I, too, can revert you tomorrow again.  \"\n",

      " What Toptchyan wrote is that after Malkhasyants (1940, and Sarkissian's article is from March 1940, so just before it) and untill Toumanoff (1961), thus \"\"second half of the 20th century\"\", there has been no serious scholarship opposing the 5th c. dating. You (Grandmaster) mentioned earlier Joseph P. Smith (1952) but (i) his book has an extremely thin link with the debate on the dating, (ii) he's not specialised in this area, and most of all (iii) he didn't take side in his very few lines on Moses. Topchyan not being contradicted on this, it is clear that there's a break of 21 years between Malkhasyants' book and the next serious scholar contesting the 5th c. dating (according to Topchyan, \"\"la publication de son livre régla la question pour environ deux décennies\"\" or in English \"\"the publishing of his book settled the issue for approximately two decades\"\"). Therefore, during these two decades, the issue didn't \"\"remain\"\" disputed (i.e. no serious scholarship published), and Toumanoff' s publishing \"\"revived\"\" the critical points in 1961.\n",
      " Where you perhaps have a point (with \"\"remains\"\") is that Toumanoff's main point, the \"\"Bagratids argument\"\", had already been raised before by Adontz and Manandian. It had been addressed by Malkhasyants though (i.e. Moses wrote that Bagratids were tagadir ev aspet, two titles from the Arsacid period which were forgotten in latter centuries).\n",
      " I think the article should represent both the historiographical break and the historiographical link, and I think the current sentence do so (\"\"revived... continue to maintain\"\"). I tried to reword it, but in fact, the more I think about the issue and the more I read the sentence, the less I see the problem with it.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Oh, btw, no need to attack Toptchyan: Mahé for instance gives absolutely no reference between 1940 and 1961.   \n",

It is this traditional and unquestioned view that has been subjected to much severe criticism during the course of the past hundred years. The object of this paper is to summarize and evaluate such criticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "So according to Sarkissian, during the 100 years before 1940 the 5th century dating was constantly in dispute. Thus, Topchyan contradicts other sources. Criticism was not revived, it always existed. If you insist on revived claim, it must be presented only as Topchyan's personal opinion, and not as a fact, because it is not true. master \"\n",

      "\n",
      "In my view, if there WAS a turning point in the war on Japan, Midway has to be it. While the Japanese had been stopped at Coral Sea, they still had the initiative; they could still choose where and when to attack, and the allies had to react. But not after Midway! It was, after all, THEY that launched the Midway/Aleutians operation, and THEY that were then rocked back on their heels, and THEY that fled afterward. It was THEY that had lost 2/3 of their big, fast carriers (and the carrier was to the War in the Pacific what the ballistic missile was to the Cold War. Somewhere above someone argues that the remainder of the Japanese fleet was still a formidable force, but that is nonsense; all that force could do would be to sail out and get sunk by a carrier-equipped US NAvy)). Far from being \"\"merely\"\" a tactical victory, it changed the whole complexion of the war. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, while they DID attempt some more offensive action (notably by trying to take Port Moresby, again, this time over land via the Kokoda Trail in the 2nd half of 1942), this was all relatively minor, designed to strengthen their DEFENSIVE positions not to conquer, and was  ultimately almost all unsuccessful. They never again tried the kind of massive, seaborne, combined arms operation that had swept them across most of the Pacific in a just a few months. Then just 2 months after Midway the US landed on Guadalcanal, and clearly the initiative was ours, and Japan was in defensive mode. Thus the Guadalcanal campaign can't be considered the actual turning point either - by then the US was clearly on the attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think the argument that there is no turning point because Japan could never have ultimately 'won' the Pacific war works out either. Japanese planners DID know that they could not win a long war MILITARILY but that was not their plan. Strategically their plans went something like: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Start the war from as superior a position as possible (hence Pearl Harbor)\n",
      "2. Race across the Pacific, seizing resources and territory BEFORE the US could gear up for war.\n",
      "3. Attain as defensible a position as possible (Hence the Kokoda Trail offensive and takeover of the Solomons) and DIG IN.\n",
      "4. Let the US grind itself down against near impregnable fortresses. \n",
      "5.Win a favorable peace settlement when the US tires itself out throwing itself against their defenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they failed at (1) when they didn't sink the US carriers at Pearl Harbor, and only 6 months later Midway signalled the early end of (2). By the failure to take Port Moresby, they also failed at part of (3). They had some hope to succeed at (5); when the bloody costs of both Tarawa and Buna-Gona became known, US public opinion was shaken. Even as late as 1945, many americans found the though of the casualties invading Japan would cost to be appalling.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, MY conclusion is that Midway WAS *the* turning point in the Pacific. I realize this whole idea of a turning point is rather subjective, but I really think if there was one in the South Pacific, it has to be Midway.\n",

From memory, the debate ended with Dublin getting it's 1.2 million restored on the basis that a local authority administrative area doesn't necessarily define the population of a town/city when the commonly accepted boundaries are very different. Charlesland is certainly in Greystones in my view; indeed a case could be made that Delgany  and Kilcoole are now merely parts of Greystones - but of course by the same reasoning Bray is part of Dublin's population.

Though it would seem that if this were so the Buddhists would have distinguished between the Sibbi tribe and the Licchavis. It is interesting to note that the Vedic 'Rta', probably related to 'Rishi', is used in a similar sense as the secondary meaning carried with 'Massebah'\n",

I tried to edit the article, but found it is now semi-protected owing to excessive vandalism. I propose that an autoconfirmed user revise the entire paragraph as follows:\n",
      "In search of what mathmatical calculation Eiffel referred to, researchers have found that Eiffel used empirical and graphical methods accounting for the effects of wind rather than a specific mathmatical formula. Careful examination of the tower shows a basically exponential shape; actually two different exponentials, the lower section overdesigned to ensure resistance to wind forces. Several mathmatical explanations have been proposed over the years; the most recent is described as a nonlinear integral equation based on counterbalancing the wind pressure on any point on the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point. As a demonstration of the tower's effectiveness in wind resistance, it sways only 6–7 cm (2–3 in) in the wind.\n",
